The water cycle describes the continuous movement of water on, above and below the surface of the Earth. Water can change states among liquid, vapor, and ice at various places in the water cycle. Condensation is the process by which water vapor in the air is changed into liquid water. The continuous movement of water from the Earth’s surface to the atmosphere and back is driven by solar energy and gravity. Evaporation occurs when the Sun heats up water in rivers or lakes or the ocean and turns it into vapor.
